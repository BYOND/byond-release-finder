## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can email [Stephen001](mailto:stephen001@byondlabs.io) and include "[SECURITY]" and the name of the repository in the title of the email. Once triaged, a summarised issue will be created in the repository that you can subscribe to for updates.
